    Constructor:
        subsumption(inner, hierarchy)
    where
        `Ã¬nner` is a comparer that can compare one concept with another concept
        `hierarchy` is the name of a hierarchy (a table in the underlying SQL
            database) which defines the hierarchy to use when determining
            whether a concept is a superclass of another concept
    
    Usage:
        .compare(one, two)
    where
        `one` is a concept
        `two` is a sequence of concepts.
    
    Returns returns 1 if any of the concepts in `two` is a superclass of `one`.
    Otherwise, compare the concept `one` with all concepts in `two` using the
    `inner` comparer, supplied at construction time, and return the maximum of
    those values.
